# Tic-Tac-Toe

• Create a 3x3 Grid inside a Canvas2D.
• 1 Players plays against himself.
• The game has 2 symbols, X and O.
• All squares start blank.
• The goal is to make a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of the same symbol.
• The player clicks on an empty square to make a move. X goes first, followed by O.
• Once a full line is made, do something to indicate the win (up to you).
• In case of a tie, restart the game.
